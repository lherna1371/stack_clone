StackUnderflow

This repository is a clone of Stack Overflow. We wanted to be able to replicate most of the site's features while learning about Ruby on Rails 4. 

The project allows for users to create accounts and ask/answer questions. Both questions and answers are given Up and Down votes to signify the general public's agreeance with the question/answer. The total votes also helps displaying popular questions.

While users (members) can post to the site, anyone can view questions, answers, and public profiles.

Both questions and answers can receive comments asking for clarification.

Administrators can also be generated by anyone who manages the database.
